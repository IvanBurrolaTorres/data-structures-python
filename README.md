# Data Structures & Algorithm Fundamentals (Python)

This repository contains manual implementations of core data structures and basic algorithmic concepts using Python.

The purpose of this repository is to build a strong foundation in:

- Algorithmic thinking
- Time complexity analysis (Big-O)
- Data structure implementation from scratch
- Clean and testable Python code

---

## Implemented Structures (Phase 0)

- [ ] Array fundamentals
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Hash Map (basic implementation)
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Big-O analysis documentation

---

## Goals

- Implement each structure manually
- Write unit tests
- Document time and space complexity
- Keep commits small and structured
